# MODULE_1: GEN-AI Module-1
## Overview
The `MODULE_1` directory contains three standalone Python command-line tools: a calculator, a file parser, and a student management system. Each tool is located in its own subdirectory with its own `README.md` file for detailed instructions.

```

## Tools Overview
1. **Calculator** (`Calculator/calculator.py`):
   - A command-line tool for performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and floor division).
   - Features input validation and the ability to continue or exit calculations.

2. **File Parser** (`file_parse/file.py`):
   - A command-line tool for parsing text files, with functionality to count lines, words, and characters, search for keywords, and extract line ranges.
   - Includes a sample text file (`sample.txt`) for testing.

3. **Student Management System** (`SMS/sms.py`):
   - A command-line tool for managing student records, allowing users to add, remove, search, and display student information with validation for IDs, ages, and grades.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- No additional dependencies (all scripts use the Python standard library)

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone or download the repository**:
   - If using Git, clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone <repo-url>
     cd MODULE_1
     ```
   - Alternatively, download and extract the `MODULE_1` directory.

2. **Navigate to a tool’s directory**:
   - Each tool has its own directory (`Calculator`, `file_parse`, or `SMS`).
   - Refer to the `README.md` in each directory for specific instructions.

3. **Run a script**:
   - Navigate to the desired tool’s directory and run the script. For example:
     ```bash
     cd Calculator
     python calculator.py
     ```
   - See each tool’s `README.md` for detailed usage instructions.

## Usage
- Each tool is independent and can be run directly from its directory.
- Refer to the individual `README.md` files for detailed examples and instructions:
  - `Calculator/README.md`
  - `file_parse/README.md`
  - `SMS/README.md`
